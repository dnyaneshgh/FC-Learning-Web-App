Project description:
The project: Flashcard learning Webapp is a customised web application where user can create and segregate own set of questions for various topics and enter their answers and hints for future studies.
the concept of the client order is to design something that allows user to learn from the mistakes.
that means the project works on an algorithm which identifies the incorrectly answered questions by the user and show it to the user unless the user does not get it correct.
